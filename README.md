This is an app with the targetted functionality of providing a service that would allow for an individual to "Check-In" or "Check-out" an infant when tranporting an infant or young child in a vehicle. This app would be able to detect when the user has ceased driving and would alert the user to ensure that the infant or child had been properly unloaded in order to prevent scenarios of negligence where the helpless passenger would be succeptible to succumbing to heat stroke or other difficulties that come from being left unattended in a vehicle for an extended period of time.
